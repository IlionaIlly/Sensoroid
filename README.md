# Sensoroid
A sensing framework for android mobile devices. 

A sensing and data processing framework for accessing sensor values on 
Android mobile devices and making them available to other applications.
The goal is to bring the sensing capabilities of smartphone devices to IoT architectures. 
Implementing this mobile sensing framework we intend to facilitate the interface between the IoT system, 
the user application and device hardware drivers. 
This work will help developers to focus on writing minimal pieces of sensor-specific code enabling an ecosystem of reusable sensor drivers.
